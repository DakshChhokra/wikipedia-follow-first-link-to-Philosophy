In wikipedia it is theoretically possible to reach the Philosophy page by just clicking on the first link on every page from 97% of all wikipedia pages. Common estimates suggest that it takes a median of 23 clicks to get from most pages to the Philosophy page. 

We want to test this hypothesis by going through a representative sample of wikipedia pages and storing their paths to Philosophy. We want to check the median path size after starting at a random selection of pages. There are 29 million pages on wikipedia in English right now, and we want to sample a representative distribution and check if the 97% number is accurate.


Things used in project: Graph and graph algorithms, Information Networks(Web Scraping)

We used graph algorithms and graph representation for the analysis of paths from a random “start page” to the “target page”. Once we have all the individual paths, we can use graph traversal algorithms to find the “funnels” where different paths converge.
